Bessel's correction - Delta Degrees of Freedom ddof=1 or using n-1 - why do we use n-1 ?

Numpy assume DDOF = 0 as default.
Pandas assume DDOF = 1 as default.

Stay tuned for the youtube video of this handwritten blog post which will give you detailed context about this topic with real life example ..
