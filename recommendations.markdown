<i> Travis took in <b>UGBA-88(Data and decisions)</b> and <b>UGBA-101b (Macroeconomics)</b> with Kunal. </i>
<p>
<b>Jan 27 2025</b>: I had the pleasure of being a student of, and working with, Kunal Cholera. While an econ undergrad, Kunal was my GSI for two classes. I immediately recognized that he was different from not only all other GSIs, but different from most other professors: he was incredibly passionate. I would later find out that Kunal was not only a standout GSI, but also a former big tech executive, and a talented engineer. I knew that there was a lot that I could learn from him, so I chose to befriend him. This decision turned out to be instrumental for me. Through chats and discussions I came to discover just how knowledgeable he was in every domain he expressed interest in. His instructional videos on YouTube were absolutely critical to my success at Cal, his explanations of economic concepts were succinct and easy to interpret. As a GSI, Kunal would always find time to chat about my future goals to pursue an MBA, where he offered actionable insights on how to achieve this goal.
<p>

Upon graduation, Kunal was offered a lecturer position at Haas and reached out to me regarding a reader position for Data and Decisions. I jumped at the opportunity to work with him and to learn even more. It turns out that working for/with Kunal would be just as rewarding as my GSI experience with him! He was great at encouraging me to find solutions and take ownership on developing strategies that had an actual impact on the success of Haas undergrads. Kunal’s instructions are clear, but also adaptable if there was a better way to do something. His constant encouragement and support for me to develop my own solutions showed his trust and empathy, while also allowing for my own growth. Kunal was always open to creative solutions and expressed gratitude for tools I helped develop to streamline and automate processes. In addition, when a concern did arise, he would always make sure I was heard and respected. 
<p>

I have worked professionally for nearly 2 decades and I’ve completed over 200 college credits. I’ve had many bosses and many professors: Kunal Cholera is somehow the best in both domains. His dedication to knowledge, passion for teaching, extensive academic and professional experience, and deep empathy regardless of rank make him not only a great educator, but also a great person and a joy to be around. I cannot recommend Kunal enough to any prospective reader, GSI, or teaching assistant.
